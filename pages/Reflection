What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
During the stages of the planning process i dont believe i wouldve done anything differently. I went off of what i knew off the top of my head and used additional resources to be able to be able to  complete the project. 


What would you add to or change about your website if given more time?
If i had more time i would make sure that the appearance of my website was better visually. I would take the time out to add additional things so it coule become more user friendly. This will be something i will continue to work on in the near future
